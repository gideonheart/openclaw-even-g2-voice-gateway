## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3-phase quick-depth roadmap -- foundation pipeline first, configuration/hardening second, provider extensibility third
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 carries 17 requirements because the end-to-end pipeline is one coherent delivery boundary -- you cannot verify any piece independently

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- OpenClaw WebSocket protocol details need validation against running instance before openclaw-client package is finalized
- Even Hub audio format (WebM/Opus vs CAF/AAC) needs confirmation for test fixtures
